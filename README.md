# BLV-ender-3-duet2
This repository contains my Reprapfirmware configuration for my BLV modded Ender 3 Pro.
Please not that this configuration is not "final, there is still issues to resolve and settings to optimise.

## Why?
I did not have many refferences for my configuration, so i decided to upload my own configuration if someone else would like to look at it.

# FAQ
Q: How did you connect your duet 2 wifi to a hidden wifi?
A: First i entered the wifi password via console.
   ```
   M587 S"MyHiddenSSID" P"MySecretWifiPassword!"
   ```
   Second, i added a line in config.g in order to connect to the hidden wifi on boot
