This repository contains my Reprap firmware (currently 2.x) configuration for my BLV modded Ender 3 Pro.

Please note that this configuration is not "final", there is still issues to resolve and settings to optimize.

## Why?
I did not have many references for my configuration, so i decided to upload my own configuration if someone else would like to look at it.

# FAQ
Q: How did you connect your duet 2 WiFi to a hidden WiFi?
A: First i entered the WiFi password via console.
   ```
   M587 S"MyHiddenSSID" P"MySecretWifiPassword!"
   ```
   Second, i added a line in config.g in order to connect to the hidden WiFi on boot
